Revision history for Perl extension Form::Processor.

0.19_1 Fri Nov 04 04:00:00 UTC 2008
    Convert to Moose. Add Catalyst Controller. Add "fields" option to profile.
    Add "unique" flag on field. Add "unique_message". Add ability for DBIC
    model to use DBIC non-column accessors. Add tests.

0.19 Fri Jul 25 17:47:36 UTC 2008
    Fix spelling error in error message in "test_ranges".


0.18 Thu Feb 28 04:46:06 UTC 2008
    No Changes -- just added version numbers to fields to
    make CPAN indexer happy.

0.17 Thu Feb 28 03:58:59 UTC 2008
    Allow for a zero id passed in as a single parameter
    to new.  An integer primary key of zero is asking for
    trouble...

0.16 Sat Jan 19 22:41:56 UTC 2008
    Changed the field's "id" method to be mutable.

    Changed the "test_multiple" field method to look at input
    catch multiple values in all cases not just for fields with
    options.

0.15 Sat Dec  1 18:16:30 UTC 2007
    Fixed failing tests when recommended modules did not exist.
    Got spanked by CPAN testers for that one.


0.14 Thu Nov 29 13:50:31 UTC 2007
    Moved to Module::Install for questionable reasons

    Removed field dependencies to make installation less
    of a pain for those that do not need all field types.

    Added new fields:
        WeekdayStr
        MD5_Password
        Date_yyy_mm_dd
        CIDR_List

    A bit more docs for fields.  As with all modules,
    looking at the source is always a good idea.

0.13 Not released to CPAN
        Added "min_length" to Text field.


0.12 Fri Jun 22 03:27:33 UTC 2007
        Fixed problem with loading fields prefixed with a plus sign.

        Forced checkboxes to value="1" in form_widgets.tt since
        HTML::FillInForm uses value="on".

        Added range_start and range_end to base class
        (was only in IntRange before).

0.11 Mon Jun 18 19:10:13 UTC 2007
        Uncommented dependencies on Html::Tidy and Template Toolkit.
        The tests checks that all fields compile now so need to include
        all dependencies and CPAN testers complain when not all tests pass.

        Add size attribute to Text field type, and validate on that size.
        Also gives a way for markup to add a size to text input fields.


0.10 Tue Jun 12 14:14:50 UTC 2007
        Fix missing init_options in Select.pm

0.09 Tue Jun 12 05:00:57 UTC 2007
        Moved Catalyst::Plugin::Form::Processor
        to separate module.
        Moved Catalyst demo application to Catalyst Plugin.
        Weakened form and parent_field to avoid circular references
        and removed DESTROY method.
        Devel::Cycle is handy.

0.08 Mon Jun 11 06:14:25 UTC 2007
        Added Hidden and Upload field types.
        Added demo Catalyst application (in t/example)
        Worked on a few of the compound fields a bit.

0.07 Wed Apr 11 15:49:45 PDT 2007
        Add in dependencies to Makefile.PL
        0.08 will have more complete tests

0.06 Tue Apr 10 23:45:15 UTC 2007
        Added Locale::Maketext support.
        Language files are empty and can be provided by
        the user as needed, or a L::M language handle can be
        passed if using site-wide lexicons.

0.05 Sun Apr  8 17:45:07 UTC 2007
        Removed locale-dependent tests

0.04 Sat Apr  7 05:32:38 UTC 2007
        Add UNIVERSAL::require as dependency.
        Caught by a fine CPAN tester.

0.03 Tue Apr  3 21:35:36 UTC 2007
        Rename to Form::Processor for CPAN release

0.02 2006-06-04
