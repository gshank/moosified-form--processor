=head1 NAME

Form::Processor::Field::DateTime - Maps to the current DateTime module.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See L<Form::Processor>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a module that allows mapping the DateTime field to
the actual field used.  Makes it easier to remap all the forms
in an application to a new field type by overriding instead of
editing all the forms.

Currently this is simply a subclass of L<Form::Processor::Field::DateTimeManip>.
