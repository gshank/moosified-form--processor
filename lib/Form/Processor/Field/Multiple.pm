=head1 NAME

Form::Processor::Field::Multiple - Select one or more options

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See L<Form::Processor>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This inherits from the Select field, which just provides options.
and sets the "multiple" flag true to accept multiple options.
If a field inherits from Select but you want to use it as a multiple
select then just define the file as such.

This also will arrange the currently selected items to the top of the list.

=head2 Widget

Fields can be given a widget type that is used as a hint for
the code that renders the field.

This field's widget type is: "select".

=head2 Subclass

Fields may inherit from other fields.  This field
inherits from: "Select".
