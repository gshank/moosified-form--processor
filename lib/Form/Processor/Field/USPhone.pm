=head1 NAME

Form::Processor::Field::USPhone - Validate that the input looks like a US phone number

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See L<Form::Processor>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This removes any non-digits and then tests that there are ten digits.

This is probably not that useful as valid phone numbers may not need to contain
ten digits -- and that additional input data may be important.

=head2 Widget

Fields can be given a widget type that is used as a hint for
the code that renders the field.

This field's widget type is: "text".

=head2 Subclass

Fields may inherit from other fields.  This field
inherits from: "Text".
